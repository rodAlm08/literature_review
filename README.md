# Research Methods in Computing and IT Repository

#### Rodrigo Almeida - G00377123

## Introduction
Welcome to this repository that focuses on a literature review project for the 'Research Methods in Computing and IT' module. Titled "Why Explain a Decision Made by AI? Explainable AI (XAI)", the review was written using LaTeX in Visual Studio, while Jupyter Notebook served as the platform for executing and presenting Python code. 

The combination of advanced tools enhances Explainable AI (XAI) exploration and comprehension of decision-making processes.
## Features
- A detailed literature review on Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP and LIME.
- Use of LaTeX for professional documentation of the review and findings.
- Application of Visual Studio for development and Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution.
- Case studies, including analysis of the "Adult Income" dataset, to showcase XAI applications.
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step algorithm explanations and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To begin exploring this project, clone the repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/rodAlm08/literature_review.git`


### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio with LaTeX support or a LaTeX editor plugin.
- Python 3.11.5
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `SHAP`, `LIME`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up your environment:

#### Python and Required Libraries
1. Ensure Python 3.11.5 or higher is installed. If not, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required Python libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is crucial for running the project's notebooks:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook via pip:

    ```
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

3. Access and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory of the cloned repository.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with algorithm implementations and explanations.
- `data/`: Data files for case studies, including the "Adult Income" dataset.
- `images/`: Image assets used in the repository.
- `main.pdf`: The compiled document of the literature review created using LaTeX.

## Usage
The primary resource in this repository is the compiled document `main.pdf`, which presents the comprehensive literature review on Explainable AI (XAI). This document, which was created using LaTeX within Visual Studio, is the result of the research and analysis conducted for the project. 

To access the literature review:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
2. Open the `main.pdf` file to view the complete literature review.

In addition to the literature review, you can explore practical implementations and code examples in the Jupyter notebooks provided. These notebooks contain the code stubs that complement the theoretical concepts discussed in the literature review.

To explore the Jupyter notebooks:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory within the repository.
3. Select a notebook to open and interact with the code examples.
